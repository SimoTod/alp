# Example of Custom Element for SimoTod 

You can run here:
- https://cekvenich.github.io/alp/
and view source.


Other:
- The main part of code is export class Custel1 extends AlpCustElement { // it imports the class that has x-data attribute setter

- Instead of walk, it maybe more efficent to have an event bus. 
I use one.

- Did not deal w/ style, as that is standard with known workarounds.
